## 👥 Authors
This work was completed as a **group assignment** by:  
- Mikael Alves Brito  
- Georg Matthes
- Viktor Maximilian Lehnhausen  

## 📝 Description
The exercise focused on:
- Comparing **Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets)** and **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**  
- Understanding invariance and equivariance in both architectures  
- Implementing ResNet-style ConvNet blocks and testing variations (BasicBlockv2, BasicBlockv3)  
- Implementing a Vision Transformer (ViT) with multi-head self-attention using only `nn.Linear`  
- Training and evaluating both ConvNet and ViT models on image classification tasks  
- Experimenting with order of operations and hyperparameter modifications to improve performance  

## ⚠️ Note
This project was created as part of a **university exercise sheet** and is **not individual work**.  
All results were prepared collaboratively by Group 11.
